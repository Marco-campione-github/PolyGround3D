How to build:
- Put Asset, Packages and ProjectSettings directories in the same directory.
- Open that directory in the Unity Hub as a Project.
- In Unity go to build settings and switch platform to Android.
- Hit Build and Run and Unity will generate all the build files needed for the project to run.
